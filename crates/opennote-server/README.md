# OpenNote Server

Self-hosted backend server for OpenNote. Sync your notes across devices by running your own server. All communications are strictly encrypted.

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Run with Docker

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name opennote-server \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -e SERVER_PASSWORD=your-secret-password \
  -v opennote_data:/root/.config/opennote_server \
  ghcr.io/<your-username>/opennote-server:latest
```

### Option 2: Build from Source

```bash
cargo build --release --package opennote-server
./target/release/opennote-server
```

## Configuration

The server reads `configurations.json` from `~/.config/opennote_server/` (inside the container) on first run. On macOS, it will be `/Users/yourusername/Library/Application Support/opennote_server/`. On Windows, it is `C:\Users\yourusername\AppData\Roaming\opennote_server`.

Defaults:

| Setting    | Default                 |
| ---------- | ----------------------- |
| Host       | `0.0.0.0`               |
| Port       | `8080`                  |
| Workers    | `4`                     |
| Shared Key | `[0u8; 32]` (all zeros) |

If the host in the configuration is `localhost`, change it to `0.0.0.0`.

The communication between the desktop app and the server is strictly encrypted with the shared key. By default, it uses all zeros. If you would like to increase the security, you may change the shared key.

### Environment Variables

| Variable                          | Description                                              | Default           |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| `SERVER_PASSWORD`                 | Password clients must send in the `Authorization` header | `""` (empty)      |
| `DEFAULT_SQLITE_DATA_FOLDER_NAME` | Folder name for SQLite data                              | `opennote_server` |

Set `SERVER_PASSWORD` to protect your server. Without it, anyone who can reach the server can access your data.

## Connect from the Desktop App

Edit `~/.config/opennote/configurations.json` and add a remote server entry under `user.remote_servers`:

```json
{
  "user": {
    "remote_servers": {
      "my-server": {
        "connection_string": "http://<server-ip>:8080",
        "password": "your-secret-password",
        "shared_key": "0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

After restarting the desktop app, a new tab will appear in the sidebar. Click it to switch to the remote server.

Note: the `password` field must match the `SERVER_PASSWORD` set on the server. The `shared_key` must match the server's shared key (a 32-byte array). All communication between the client and server is encrypted using this shared key.
